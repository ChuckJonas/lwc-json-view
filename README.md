# LWC React-Webpack Container

This project is meant to demonstrate how you can use webpack to bundle a react application and mount it in a LWC. 

While this approach works, I cannot reasonable recommend taking this approach at this time.  

## Setup

- npm install
- create a scratch org.  Set as default
- `npm run deploy`
